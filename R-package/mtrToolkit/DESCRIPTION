Title: A R Toolkit for multi-target regression methods
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Saulo Martiello Mastelini
Maintainer: Saulo Martiello Mastelini <saulomastelini@gmail.com>
Description: This packages currently implements Multi-target Regression Trees and Ensembles thereof, as in the Clus framework. Besides that, a novel method called k-Random Clusters Regression Tree (KRCRT) is presented. As its name indicates, KRCRT creates random clusters for partitioning data and building multi-target regression trees. KRCRT is intended for use in ensembles.
    In a next future the following local-based methods will be added to the Toolkit: Single-target (ST), Multi-target Regressor Stacking (MTRS), Ensemble of Regressor Chains (ERC), Deep Stacking for Tracking Asyncronous Regressor Stacking (DSTARS), Multi-output Tree Chaining (MOTC), Multi-Target Augmented Stacking (MTAS), Multi-target Stacked Generalizator (MTSG), and Deep Regressor Stacking (DRS).
